Using the api available at https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs please create a basic api and front end app which does the following:

Delivers an API that is callable from a React built client and returns the following unauthenticated information:

1. A feed of all public items classified as “Prints”, paged in pages of 10, ordered by rank, descending, that have images and have been verified to the ‘Best’ standard.
2. Provide a basic react driven front end for the feed that displays the image.
3. Provide information on the detail of print you feel may be relevant (title etc).
4. Commit your code for the server and the client to GitHub and provide us with the url to the repository.
5. Add any tests you feel are required, where necessary.



Notes:
Design is not important here, we are more interested in coding style and practices. 
You may use Express, Bootstrap, Redux, Create-React-App or other 3rd party libraries / npm modules etc
